  This function creates and returns a float with the value 0.5
  You cannot just "return 0.5;"!

  The 32-bit value 0x3f000000 is the value of 0.5 in IEEE 754.

  If we use an array to access the bytes, wwe have to return
  it in reverse order. Since the array is stored in little-endian
  byte order, the most significant bits of the float are in index [3]!
