- Discussion: 

We saw sharp decrease in elapsed time from regular to 
parallel selection sort (16 threads): Elapsed time is 57, 140 and 184 
times faster for increasing array size; user time is 6, 9, 11 times faster;
and system time is slightly slower for parallel 16 threads sort but not 
noticeable.

The decrease is less steep from parallel 16 threads to parallel 64 threads, 
but the speedup is still noticeable: Elapsed time has no increase, 2 times
and 3 times faster; user time is 0.2, 4 and 4 times faster; and
system time is slight slower.

To conclude, parallel sort is much faster, but with less speed increment
as we add to many threads. A pattern where system time increase when we 
use more threads is also seen.
